## Creative Commons Donation Form Tweaks

The donation form uses [GravityForms](http://www.gravityforms.com/).

To make it do its thing:

 * Go to "Form Settings" and check the "Apply donation form behaviours" box.
 * Give your monthly amount field the Admin Field Label "cc_amount_monthly"
 * Give your one-time amount field the Admin Field Label "cc_amount_onetime"
 * Give your frequency field the Admin Field Label "cc_frequency"
 * Give your final amount field the Admin Field Label "cc_amount"
 * Give any display amount markup fields the content "`<!-- cc_display_amount -->`"
